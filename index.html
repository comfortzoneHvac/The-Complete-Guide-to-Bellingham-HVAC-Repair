                <p>Bellingham's unique climate presents specific challenges for HVAC systems. Here are some prevalent issues homeowners face:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Leaky Ducts:</b> Air escaping from ducts can lead to increased energy bills and uneven cooling or heating. Sealing leaks improves system efficiency and helps maintain consistent indoor temperatures.</li>
                    <li><b>Dirty Filters:</b> Clogged filters reduce airflow, causing the system to work harder and potentially leading to overheating. Regularly replacing or cleaning filters also improves indoor air quality.</li>
